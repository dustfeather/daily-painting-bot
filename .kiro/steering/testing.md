# Testing Guidelines

## Test File Policy

- DO NOT create test files during implementation unless explicitly requested by the user
- DO NOT add test coverage or test suites automatically
- If test files are created temporarily for validation, remove them before completing the task
- Focus on delivering working implementation code rather than test infrastructure
